This project is not finished. I only made this out of boredom, but if anybody actually likes the idea, please let me know.

Key Features:
- Works seamlessly on any computer with Windows, Mac, or Linux
- Simple to use
- Can run script files with a list of commands
- Can interact with the OS's built in terminal
- Can interact directly with python and pip
- Easy to modify

Here is a simplified list of commands, since I haven't made the help page, yet:
- cls
- exit
- help
- os
- echo
- wait
- call
- del
- pause
- python
- pip
