A Universal Terminal for Any User on any Operating system
-
A terminal that functions the exact same on every major operating system (Windows, MacOS, and Linux), and is so easy to use, even with so many features, that a beginner and an experienced programmer could both use it for everything.

PLEASE NOTE:
This project is in beta. Expect Bugs!

Key Features:
- Works seamlessly on any computer with Windows, Mac, or Linux
- Can be updated by just typing "update"
- Very simple to use
- All commands have alternative phrases in case one is easier to remember 
- Can be scripted, like batch files
- Can interact with the OS's built in terminal (cmd, powershell, bash, etc.)
- Can interact directly with python and pip
- and more ....

To use the Universal Terminal, run `python run.py` in the same directory as the script. No repositories needed.
