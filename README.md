# Universal Terminal
A Universal Terminal for Any User on any Operating system
-
A terminal that functions the exact same on every major operating system (Windows, MacOS, and Linux), and is so easy to use, even with so many features, that a beginner and an experienced programmer could use it for everything.

PLEASE NOTE:
This project is not finished. I only made this out of boredom, and it only took me like 3-5 hours to make from the ground up. If anybody actually likes the idea, please let me know, and give me some feedback so I can improve it.

Key Features:
- Works seamlessly on any computer with Windows, Mac, or Linux
- Very Simple to use
- All commands have alternative phrases in case one is easier to remember 
- Can be scripted, like batch filed
- Can interact with the OS's built in terminal (cmd, powershell, bash, etc.)
- Can interact directly with python and pip
- and more ....

To use the Universal Terminal, run `python run.py` in the same directory as the script. No repositories needed.

I haven't made a help page, yet, but I left a lot of comments in the code, so it should be pretty easy to reverse engineer the commands. Just in case you are too lazy, here is a simplified list of the commands, anyways:
- cls - Clear
- exit - Exit
- help
- os - Runs the following arguements with the OS's terminal (like "os cmd" would open cmd or "os explorer" would open file explorer)
- echo - Echoes
- wait - Waits for a # of seconds
- call - runs a script file (.txt)
- del - deletes file or folder
- pause
- python - runs the following arguements with python
- pip - runs the following arguements with pip
